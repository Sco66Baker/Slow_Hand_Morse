# Slow_Hand_Morse
This Python program will blink Morse Code to an led. (Although Slowly) Example: $>sudo python Slow_Hand_Morse.py To start sending Morse Code to the LED from the CLI "use quotation marks and type inside". Using a Pi GPIO the led is connected from 3.3volt pin 2 (anode) to pin 11 GPIO17 (cathode). No resistor needed. So why the slow hand? As I understand it back in the day a well trained Telegraph Operator could relay messages fast and accurate unlike a "Ham Handed" amateur operator. Thanks to all Amateur Radio Operators who volunteer there time, knowledge, and equipment.
